# Photo Transfer 

Used to move photos from an external device, such as an SD card from a camera, into two file locations of your choosing. I remove my photos from an external SD card and store the ones I like locally on my computer and ones I don't like as much on an external hard drive. The user must choose their desired file locations and manually input the photo number as indicated by the photos file name. This is set up for photos in the format DSC_XXXX where XXXX is four number digits. 

Note: a directory pointing to where the photos come from must be specified for each individual case.
